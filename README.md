===========
This mod aims to finally give The Fletching Table a much needed functionality, by adding loads of vanilla-friendly arrows to craft. 


## Features

* The Fletching Table now has a functional user interface, allowing you to craft the already existing arrows in Minecraft, alongside the new arrows added in this mod.

* Crafting arrows with the fletching table yields twice as much arrow than crafting it in the crafting table, much like the stonecutter.
* All the new added arrows use materials from the base game, ranging from your basic materials like gold and iron, to much more rarer items such a echo shards and breeze rods.
* Most of the new arrows can also be obtained through different methods outside of crafting! they can be found in different structures, held by other mobs and more!
* Each new arrow comes with unique effects that can aid you in different combat scenarios, while not crossing the line of being overpowered. each also have their own unique models too so you don't have too look at those boring regular arrows ever again!
